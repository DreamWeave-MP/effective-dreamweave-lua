# Foreward

This is an attempt to standardise the strategies and styles for writing Lua code. By attempting to standardise these strategies/styles, we gain the clean and efficient code that can be easier for people to read and debug.

I would personally like to thank Manason, who did the same thing for the FiveM community and what this handbook is based on.
